        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p>Never really thought about long term but I think having a stable career where I can comfortably
        start and support a family with is something that I want. I also would love to do something that makes me 
        happy and that I am proud of.</p>
      
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      
        <p>I think my biggests strengths are being able to learn quickly and keeping calm under pressure.</p>
      
        <p>My biggest downfall would be a lack of self confidence. I tend to bring myself down when things aren't going well.
        Sometimes when I can't figure something out I will be stubborn and probably waste more time than I should instead of just asking for help.</p>
      
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      
        <p>I want to have more self confidence and be able to talk to groups without an issue.
        Knowing how to effectively self reflect would be a big thing too.</p>
      
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      
        <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
        <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      
        <p>I've started to cut back on outside of devacademy activities like sport and jamming some games with mates so I have more time to focus of getting things done.</p>
        <p>I think I will just need to take a moment to tell myself it's all good and then lock in and get it all done.</p>
        <p>I'm fortunate enough to find out I have a buddy from back in the days on the same cohort so having a chat to him would be a good start.</p>
        <p>I know there will be a lot of support with devacademy also that I could seek and also people in my family.</p>
      
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      
        <p>I don't know if I "expect" anything from the team other than just being available when needed.</p>
      
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      
        <p>I would just say that if it was still possible to fit in some form of sports that it would be on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.</p>
