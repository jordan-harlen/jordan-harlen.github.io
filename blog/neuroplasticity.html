      <h3>Discussed your understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning</h3>

      <p>Until hearing about neuroplasticity, I always thought that people were born more intelligent than others some 
        people just had the knack to learn easier than others. After learning about neuroplasticity, that thought has changed. 
        I now know through some reading about neuroplasticity that anyone can be intelligent through hard work. It is not a 
        set parameter like I believed it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        My simple way of describing neuroplasticity is that it is like creating muscle memory for a certain skill. When you 
        continually practice something you are creating paths in your brain that is almost like a step by step on how to do something. 
        For example when you are learning how to shoot a basketball, you have to think about the steps in your mind before you shoot. 
        Through continuous practice you gain muscle memory of those steps and stop having to think. You body just does it. 
        "Practice makes perfect" as Dad used to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the same through learning and something I will be doing through out my journey to becoming a dev.

      <p>
        Practice, Practice, Practice!
