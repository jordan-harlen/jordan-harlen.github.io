      <h3>Discussed your understanding of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning</h3>

      <p>Until hearing about neuroplasticity, I always thought that people were born more intelligent than others some 
        people just had the knack to learn easier than others. After learning about neuroplasticity, that thought has changed. 
        I now know through some reading about neuroplasticity that anyone can be intelligent through hard work. It is not a 
        set parameter like I believed it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        My simple way of describing neuroplasticity is that it is like creating muscle memory for a certain skill. When you 
        continually practice something you are creating paths in your brain that is almost like a step by step on how to do something. 
        For example when you are learning how to shoot a basketball, you have to think about the steps in your mind before you shoot. 
        Through continuous practice you gain muscle memory of those steps and stop having to think. You body just does it. 
        "Practice makes perfect" as Dad used to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the same through learning and something I will be doing through out my journey to becoming a dev.
      </p>

      <p>
        Practice, Practice, Practice!
      </p>

      <h3>1.	Research Neuroplasticity</h3>

      <h4>o	Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h4>

      <p>
        There are many benefits but to name a few: Recovery from brain injury, enhanced memory abilities and more effective learning.
      </p>

      <h4>o	Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>

      <p>
        I believe that I already do some form of neuroplasticity through sports if my understanding is correct. Take for example practicing to shoot in basketball. You would go to the gym and shoot 100 shots trying to perfect you shooting form. This is creating the muscle memory of your form so we it comes to a game situation you wouldn’t have to think about it, it would just happen naturally. I would like to somehow turn this thinking into how I can use it to increase my learning.
      </p>

      <h4>o	What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>

      <p>
        Exercise! A healthy body = a healthy mind. Learning a new language or my personal favourite.. Play video games!
      </p>

      <h4>o	Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h4>

      <h3>2.	Research Growth Mindset</h3>

      <h4>o	Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>

      <p>
        A growth mindset is the belief that my abilities and skill are not set and can be improved upon. It’s relevant because if I was challenged with something that I struggled with and have a   growth mind set, I would see it as an opportunity to learn. If I had a fixed mind set I would run from the challenge.
      </p>
      

      <h4>o	In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>

      <p>
        I’ve had a fixed mindset with certain things so that has changed in terms of intelligence because of the combined reading of a growth mind set and neuroplasticity. I can’t remember exactly where I read it but the thought that intelligence isn’t set in stone was pretty freeing in a way.
      </p>

      <h4>o	How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>

      <p>
        I think that having the belief that I can learn something new completely different to what I’m and outside of my comfort zone would be a great start. As well as embracing challenges as a way to enforce things I’ve read about instead of getting frustrated about getting it wrong.

      <h3>3.	Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>

      <h4>o	Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h4>

      <p>
        In my learning plan I said I was cutting back on things like playing games and exercise (gym and sports) to allow for more time spent on class work. After these readings I think I should still do these things as they can help with neuroplasticity but instead embrace the challenge of learning how to manage my time more effectively to fit everything in.
