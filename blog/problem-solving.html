      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>

      <h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

      <p>
        It was in the built in functions kata and I knew what I needed to do but for the life of me couldn't figure out how 
      to write it as an arrow function.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem solving techniques I tried was console.logging, trying something, googling and improve your process and understanding through reflection.
        I was going to ask my peers through discord for help but I realised there were already existing threads explaining the solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way I felt during the process was a tab but frustrated but when I got the right solution I felt immediate joy and satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learnt that there is a lot of power in console.logging. When I realised what was being passed to parameters through tests 
        it increased my understanding of the test and made my job a lot easier. I also learnt that there are lot of people
        asking these same questions online and there are many answers available to learn from.
      </p>
      
      <!-- what was the problem?
      what problem-solving techniques did you use?
      how did you feel throughout the process?
      what did you learn? -->
      
      <h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>

      <p>
        I'll be honest.. I don't really know what it means by elegantly solving a problem lol! But I will chuck something down here
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem was trying to get the average of the test scores in the gradebook kata.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pretty much only used google and youtube because I had no idea where to start on this. I found a solution pretty quickly 
        but could not understand what is was at all except that it was some how averaging the test scores for me. I spent a wee while
        staring at it trying to make sense of it until I remembered there was a video posted on discord about this. While watching the video
        it was explained that it wasn't a part of the learning competencies. I took that as a complete win and swiftly moved on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learnt that I should pay more attention to the learning competencies so I have a clear understanding of what I should be
        investing a lot of time in and what I shouldn't be.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>

      <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
      <p>
        5/10 I did give it a go and can see the merit in it but I need more practice with it
      </p>
      
      <h4>Trying something</h4>
      <p>
        10/10 I like just giving things a go and learning what works and what doesn't work
      </p>
      
      <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
      <p>4/10 I didn't really try this so I gave myself a low rating. Maybe I will head down to the toy store
         and get myself a rubber ducky sometime soon.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
      <p>
        7/10 Just based on the repl.it error codes, I felt some what comfortable reading them and figuring
        out where the error was and roughly what it was.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Console.logging</h4>
      <p>
        8/10 I was pretty much console.logging everything I could.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Googling</h4>
      <p>
        10/10 I could probably learn some ways to better search for things but felt pretty confident in finding
        solutions through google. Google is my hero.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
      <p>
        7/10 I didn't really do this as there were already existing threads for what I needed to know but I don't think
        I would have trouble asking a peer for help.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
      <p>
        7/10 Same as above ^^^
      </p>

      <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
      <p>
        7/10 I felt like I was reflecting to increase my understanding of what I was doing with everything that I got stuck on. 
        Can definitely get better at it but felt like my starting point was pretty good.
