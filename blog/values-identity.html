      <h2>Hello peers, facilitators and whomever else may be reading!</h2>

      <p>I've been hit with the double whammy of being terrible at writting things and not being great about talking/thinking about myself.
      Here's to trying new things!</p>

      <p>My core values are kindness and empathy. I am a firm believer in treating people the way you want to be treated.
      I also really dislike seeing people not being included and try to include everyone in things that I do.</p>

      <h3 class="values-q">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
    
      <p>An example of a situation where I have had to make an ethical decision is when I coach basketball to an intermediate school kids team.
      I like to play all my kids regardless of skill level and have them play roughly the same amount of minutes as each other.</p>

      <p>The consequence to this is we might not always win the match as we would like to. On the upside however, it teaches the kids
      to trust everyone instead of relying on one person. It also encourages them to push each other to train harder and encourage 
      each other in positive ways.</p>

      <h3 class="values-q">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    
      <p>From a young age I never really felt accepted by peers in my culture. I chose to take a general "kiwi" approach and started to embrace
      aspects from all other cultures I was exposed to. I feel like this experience really influenced my value of empathy, kindness and
      wanting everyone to be involved no matter who they are.</p>

      <h3 class="values-q">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development. 
      Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
    
      <p>In terms of learning and career, I believe my strengths are problem solving and being able to learn quickly.
      I'm great at learning by doing which I think will help me in my devacademy journey. I'm also able to stay calm under pressure.</p>

      <p>For limitations I think my personality makes it hard for me to focus on things for extended periods of time. This is something I have been working on recently.
      I also haven't really done self reflections before so this is a weakness of mine but I find it quite exciting to be working on this now.</p>

      <h3 class="values-q">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
      Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>

      <p>There was a time when I was working on a film project and my peers and I needed to design and build something to accomplish the desired effect for the scene.
      We all had similar ideas but they had their differences. The tension or resistance would be that we weren't able to easily pick who's design to go with for our rig.
      In the end we didn't use just one persons design but took the best ideas from our individual designs and made a collaborative one.
      If I was to do it again I would suggest that we collaborate from the beginning because it would've saved a lot of time and debate on who's design to use.</p>

      <p>This was my first time that I can remember writting anything about myself and it was quite interesting!
      Thanks for reading and until next post, cya :)</p>
