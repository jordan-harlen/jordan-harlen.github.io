      <h3>What is an ID?</h3>
      <p>Think of an id like you would in the real world. A drivers licence for example is unique to an indiviual person. 
        I couldn't use someone else's licence successfully!
      </p>
      <p>An ID in HTML and CSS is the same. It is used to give a single element (part of your webpage) a unique identifier.
        This is useful when you want to only style one element on your webpage.
      </p>

        <img src="../images/id-example.PNG" alt="example of an ID">
        <figcaption>Example of unique IDs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h3> What is a class?</h3>
      <p>A class is similar to an ID in the sense that you use it to assign an identifier to an element.</p>
      <p>The main difference here is that classes are not unique like IDs. You are not limited to assigning a class 
        to a single element of you webpage. You may assign the same class to how many elements you want to!
      </p>
      <p>This is useful when you want to style many elements the same way.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/class-example.PNG" alt="example of classes">
        <figcaption>Here is an example of the same class being applied to two different elements</figcaption>   
      </figure>

      <h3>Best practice using Classes and IDs</h3>
      <p>It is considered best practice to use IDs when you want a style to apply to a single element.</p>
      <p>If you want to apply a style to multiple elements you would use a class.</p>
