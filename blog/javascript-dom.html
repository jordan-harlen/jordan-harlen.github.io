      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
      <p>The first thing thing that came to mind for me was the human body.</p>
      <p>The body would be the HTML. This is the structure including your bones, organs and well.. Everything! Your body is made up of many components 
        and just like an HTML document, you could divide these components into "divs" and "ids or classes."
      </p>
      <p>Now CSS would be things like your skin, hair, hair color and eye color. Anything that
        make up the aesthetic of your body.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, Javascript would be your brain. It is what makes everything tick and it is the same for a webpage.
        JavaScript controls everything from moving parts of a webpage to being able to change the aesthetic.
      </p>

      <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer reads and runs your code. Much like humans, your computer will read 
        this code from top to bottom unless there is something written that changes that order. An example of something that changes 
        the control flow is something called a "loop".
      </p>
      <p>A loop is a way to run a block of code multiple times until a specified amount of times has told it to stop.</p>
      <p>Lets take the completely random task of cutting your fingernails. <span id="weird-example">(bear with me as it was the only example that came to my mind.. T.T)</span> If 
        you broke this down into steps, it may look something like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get clippers</li>
        <li>Cut fingernail</li>
        <li>Cut fingernail</li>
        <li>Cut fingernail</li>
        <li>Cut fingernail</li>
        <li>Cut fingernail</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You would start from the first instruction and once that is done move to the next until the list is finished. This is like the control flow. Above you
        see that you would first get your clippers then cut your fingernail five times because you have five fingers on each hand.
      </p>
      <p>Instead of writting the instruction 5 times you can create a loop for the amount of fingers you have. So with just one line of "cut fingernails" looping 5 times because you have 
        5 fingers that would finish one hand :)
      </p>

      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
      <p>The Document Object Model or more commonly referred to as the DOM is what our browsers create when a webapge is loaded.</p>
      <p>Basically, the DOM turns all of your HTML elements (body, header, h tags, p tags and so on) and turns them into objects or nodes.
        Our HTML is written in the sense that an element is a parent that can have children nested inside of it and those children can also have children.
        The DOM will display the objects in this form of hierarchy and it looks just like a family tree. Imagine ancestry.com but for HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we know what the DOM is, lets talk about a way we can interact with it.</p>
      <p>A really cool way of interacting with the DOM is actually available to pretty much anyone that has a browser and that is through something called Developer Tools.
        I won't get too much into Developer Tools but it gives you the ability to see and access the family tree of elements. By accessing the elements you are able
        to change the contents of them and even the styles. Pretty amazing stuff.
      </p>

      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
      <p>An array is a collection of data assigned to a name and stored in [ ] these little square brackets and each piece of data are called an index</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/array-example.PNG" alt="example of an array">
        <figcaption>An example of an Array</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Above is an example of an array. In this example it shows you the length of the array which is also the amount of indexes within it.
        It also shows you the position of each index also represented by a number. Humans and computer count differently so although the amount of indexes
        in the array is 4, the computer starts counting the indexes starting from 0 (insane right..). This means when I go to access the array in the 
        example through the console.log it won't show me the 4th index because it is in the 3rd position.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="gif" src="https://c.tenor.com/tvFWFDXRrmMAAAAd/blow-mind-mind-blown.gif" alt="mind blown gif">
      </figure>
      <p>An object is similar to an array because they are both collections of data but instead object use the { } curly brackets instead. The pieces of data 
        in an object are called keys and are passed a value.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/object-example.PNG" alt="example of an object">
        <figcaption>An example of an object</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Using the same console.log method, I can call this collection of data about myself and specify the key "isCool" to be logged to the console.
        The result will be the console logging that I am indeed cool or "true". A much more simpler concept to grasp.</p>

      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
      <p>In the most simplest form, a function is just a bunch of instruction you are giving the computer to complete a particular task. Once the instructions are complete
        the task is done! But what if the task comes up again later and needs to be completed again..? The beauty of functions is they are reusable! Meaning you can call 
        your function as many times as need within your script.
      </p>
      <p>What a time saver!</p>
