      <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
      <p>The first thing thing that came to mind for me was the human body.</p>
      <p>The body would be the HTML. This is the structure including your bones, organs and well.. Everything! Your body is made up of many components 
        and just like an HTML document, you could divide these components into "divs" and "ids or classes."
      </p>
      <p>Now CSS would be things like your skin, hair, hair color and eye color. Anything that
        make up the aesthetic of your body.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, Javascript would be your brain. It is what makes everything tick and it is the same for a webpage.
        JavaScript controls everything from moving parts of a webpage to being able to change the aesthetic.
      </p>

      <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
      <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer reads and runs your code. Much like humans, your computer will read 
        this code from top to bottom unless there is something written that changes that order. An example of something that changes 
        the control flow is something called a "loop".
      </p>
      <p>A loop is a way to run a block of code any amount of times until a certain condition is met.</p>
      <p>Lets take the completely random task of cutting your fingernails. <span id="weird-example">(bear with me as it was the only example that came to my mind.. T.T)</span> If 
        you broke this down into steps, it may look something like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get clippers</li>
        <li>Cut thumbnail to satisfactory length</li>
        <li>Cut index fingernail to satisfactory length</li>
        <li>Cut middle fingernail to satisfactory length</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You would start from the first instruction and once that is done move to the next until the list is finished. This is like the control flow.</p>
      <p>But what if for some crazy reason you had not acquired clippers and went straight to instruction 2? You would not be able to cut your nails and the condition would not be met
        so you would "loop" back to the start and get some clippers. There are many methods and examples to loops but this is a simplified example to demonstrate.
      </p>

      <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
      <p>The Document Object Model or more commonly referred to as the DOM is what our browsers create when a webapge is loaded.</p>
      <p>Basically, the DOM turns all of your HTML elements (body, header, h tags, p tags and so on) and turns them into objects or nodes.
        Our HTML is written in the sense that an element is a parent that can have children nested inside of it and those children can also have children.
        The DOM will display the objects in this form of hierarchy and it looks just like a family tree. Imagine ancestry.com but for HTML elements.
      </p>
      <p>Now that we know what the DOM is, lets talk about a way we can interact with it.</p>
      <p>A really cool way of interacting with the DOM is actually available to pretty much anyone that has a browser and that is through something called Developer Tools.
        I won't get too much into Developer Tools but it gives you the ability to see and access the family tree of elements. By accessing the elements you are able
        to change the contents of them and even the styles. Pretty amazing stuff.
      </p>

      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
      <p>An array is a collection of data assigned to a name and stored in [] these little square brackets</p>
